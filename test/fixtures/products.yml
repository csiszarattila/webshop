    Why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby, sometimes called W(p)GtR or just "the poignant guide", is an introductory book to the Ruby programming language, written by why the lucky stiff.
    The book is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. The book is unusual among programming books that it includes quite a lot of strange humor and narrative side tracks that don't necessarily have anything to do with the topic. 
    As a result, many bits of the book have become inside jokes in the Ruby community such as references to the words chunky bacon. 
    The book includes many characters which have become popular too, particularly the cartoon foxes and Trady Blix, a large black cat who is a friend of _why and guides the foxes through the weird world in which they find themselves (and occasionally teaches them some Ruby).
